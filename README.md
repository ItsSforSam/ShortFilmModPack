# How to download!

Download Git onto your computer.</br>
[Here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is the link to download

open your command prompt (either your windows command prompt or the Git Bash one) in your minecraft mods pack file (I recommand [CurseForge](https://download.curseforge.com/))</br>
to change the file that the command prompt to be looking at run
(update the information to fit your directory)

```bash
cd C:\Users\[user]\Twitch\Minecraft\Instances
```
>replace `[user]` with your name on the devies 

to download, run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ItsSforSamuel/ShortFilmMods.git
```
</br>
if you don't want to download a software to manage modpacks, still download this as instructed (altho the directory doesn't matter, when doing this), but then rip out the mod files and put them in the correct file

</br></br>
Side note, the server will let you in if you have an non offial Minecraft account.
>i.e using a pireted client (not remmend and you can possibly download malware/spyware)

# How to Update
>This will not work if you didn't download from git bash, then you would have to redownload from here

open git bash

go inside of the dictory that was cloned
```bash
cd C:\Users\[user]\Twitch\Minecraft\Instances\ShortFilmMods
```
>replace `[user]` with your name on the devies

then type
```bash
git fetch
```
all files will be updated, and no files will be overwritten
